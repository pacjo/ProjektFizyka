# AngryBalls - Projekt WFIT

This is a poor clone of popular Angry Birds game written in [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/)

## Notes

when exporting you'll need to set proper values for Android SDK and java paths.

also on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) `apksigner` will be broken. Shebang need's to be replaced with something like `#!/usr/bin/env bash` as mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/wg8saw/how_do_you_use_godot_engine_android_export/).

## Licensing

All image assets (so anything in `assets` directory) isn't our creation and is here for demonstrational purposes only.
